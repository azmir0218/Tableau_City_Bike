##Data
For this analysis data from the 2020 was used. Invdividual files were downloaded for the 12 months and combined into one big file using Pandas so it would for easier to import and manipulate in Tableau. To reduce the file size to Tableau's 15 mil row limit the birth years before 1949 were taken out and nulls/unknown for gender were removed.
